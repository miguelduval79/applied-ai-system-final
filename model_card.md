# DocuBot Model Card

This model card is a short reflection on your DocuBot system. Fill it out after you have implemented retrieval and experimented with all three modes:

1. Naive LLM over full docs  
2. Retrieval only  
3. RAG (retrieval plus LLM)

Use clear, honest descriptions. It is fine if your system is imperfect.

## 2. Retrieval Design

**How does your retrieval system work?**  
Describe your choices for indexing and scoring.

- How do you turn documents into an index?
- How do you score relevance for a query?
- How do you choose top snippets?

> _Your answer here._

**What tradeoffs did you make?**  
For example: speed vs precision, simplicity vs accuracy.

## 3. Use of the LLM (Gemini)

**When does DocuBot call the LLM and when does it not?**  
Briefly describe how each mode behaves.

- Naive LLM mode:
- Retrieval only mode:
- RAG mode:

> _Your answer here._

**What instructions do you give the LLM to keep it grounded?**  
Summarize the rules from your prompt. For example: only use snippets, say "I do not know" when needed, cite files.

> _Your answer here._

## 4. Experiments and Comparisons

Run the **same set of queries** in all three modes. Fill in the table with short notes.

You can reuse or adapt the queries from `dataset.py`.

| Query | Naive LLM: helpful or harmful? | Retrieval only: helpful or harmful? | RAG: helpful or harmful? | Notes |
|------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| Example: Where is the auth token generated? | | | | |
| Example: How do I connect to the database? | | | | |
| Example: Which endpoint lists all users? | | | | |
| Example: How does a client refresh an access token? | | | | |

**What patterns did you notice?**  

- When does naive LLM look impressive but untrustworthy?  
- When is retrieval only clearly better?  
- When is RAG clearly better than both?

> _Your answer here._

## 5. Failure Cases and Guardrails

**Describe at least two concrete failure cases you observed.**  
For each one, say:

- What was the question?  
- What did the system do?  
- What should have happened instead?

> _Failure case 1 here._

> _Failure case 2 here._

**When should DocuBot say “I do not know based on the docs I have”?**  
Give at least two specific situations.

> _Your answer here._

**What guardrails did you implement?**  
Examples: refusal rules, thresholds, limits on snippets, safe defaults.

> _Your answer here._

## RAG Evaluation and Observations

I tested DocuBot using all three modes: Naive LLM, Retrieval Only, and RAG.

### Naive LLM Mode
The Naive LLM mode attempted to answer questions without retrieval grounding. This approach can sound confident even when the answer is not fully supported by the documentation. During testing, the Gemini API quota prevented complete evaluation, but the architecture showed how a model can attempt to answer using only its general reasoning abilities.

### Retrieval Only Mode
The Retrieval Only mode produced the most reliable evidence-based results. It successfully returned focused snippets from AUTH.md for the question:

> "Where is the auth token generated?"

The system also correctly refused unrelated questions such as:

> "What is the refund policy?"

This mode demonstrated strong grounding and low hallucination risk, but the responses were less natural because they only returned raw snippets.

### RAG Mode
RAG mode combined retrieval with generation. The retrieval pipeline worked correctly and passed relevant snippets into the LLM layer. However, Gemini API quota limitations prevented full response generation during testing.

Even without full generation, the architecture demonstrated how RAG systems improve reliability by forcing the model to use retrieved evidence instead of relying only on model memory.

### Key Learning
One important lesson from this project is that retrieval quality matters more than simply using a powerful model. Better snippet selection, stop-word filtering, and guardrails significantly improved reliability and reduced incorrect answers.

# Ethical Reflection and AI Collaboration

## Limitations and Biases

DocuBot Pro relies on keyword-based retrieval and lightweight scoring instead of semantic embeddings or vector search. Because of this, retrieval quality depends heavily on exact wording and token overlap between the query and the documentation.

The system may also miss valid answers if:
- the query uses different terminology
- retrieval thresholds are too strict
- relevant snippets contain weak keyword overlap

Additionally, the project uses a small local documentation set rather than a large production-scale knowledge base, so retrieval behavior is simplified compared to enterprise RAG systems.

---

## Potential Misuse and Prevention

Like many AI systems, a retrieval assistant could still be misused if users assume all generated answers are automatically correct.

To reduce this risk, the project includes:
- retrieval grounding
- refusal guardrails
- threshold-based evidence checks
- explicit “I do not know” behavior

The system is intentionally designed to refuse unsupported questions instead of generating speculative answers.

## What Surprised Me During Testing

Another surprising realization was understanding that AI hallucination is not necessarily caused by “bad intelligence,” but often by missing or statistically weak information. During testing, it became clear that when the system lacked strong contextual evidence, the model still attempted to complete patterns confidently.

This changed my perspective on AI systems. It reinforced the idea that modern language models are fundamentally advanced pattern recognition systems operating on probabilities rather than true understanding. Working on retrieval and grounding mechanisms made me think more critically about the meaning of intelligence, reasoning, and reliability in AI systems.

One surprising observation was how easily weak retrieval logic could produce misleading results even without a hallucinating language model.

Early versions retrieved entire documents instead of focused snippets, which buried important information and sometimes surfaced unrelated content.

Another important lesson was that retrieval tuning mattered more than expected. Small changes to:
- stop-word filtering
- snippet size
- scoring thresholds

significantly changed the quality and reliability of the system.

## Collaboration with AI

AI tools were used throughout the project to:
- explain unfamiliar code
- reason about retrieval behavior
- suggest refactoring approaches
- analyze guardrail logic

One particularly helpful suggestion was using snippet-based retrieval instead of returning full documents. This improved retrieval precision and made answers significantly more focused and interpretable.

However, not all AI suggestions were reliable. In some cases, AI-generated code introduced incorrect indentation, overly aggressive retrieval thresholds, or logic that returned irrelevant snippets. These situations required manual debugging and careful reasoning before accepting the AI’s recommendations.

This project reinforced the idea that AI is most effective as a collaborative engineering tool rather than an authority that should be trusted blindly.
